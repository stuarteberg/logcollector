This module contains the following:

- A convenience decorator to send all logging messages within a function over HTTP
- A server to receive those log messages, cache them in local log files, and serve those log files over http. 

Next steps:

- Allow configuration of the local log file storage.
- Define a simple protocol for "special" log messages for info on status and progress, and display that on the index page.
- Server shutdown isn't thought out yet (when to shut down, close file handles, etc.)
